## Reflection

This project was an exercise, helping me to understand TypeScript and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Except for TypeScript I used here React, React-Router, Sass, Material, and Prettier.

This artbook are based on:

> npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
